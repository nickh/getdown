# Get Down!

This is an experiment to see if there's an easier way to follow along when
I'm playing music.

I find that when I'm looking at the lyrics, I lose track of the chords.
Conversely, when I'm looking at the chords, I lose track of the lyrics.
My hope is that colorizing the lyrics to match the chords lets my brain
follow along better.

## Get Started

- `bundle`
- `rake db:create db:migrate db:setup`
- `rails s`
- Browse to http://localhost:3000/
